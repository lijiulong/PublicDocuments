# Introduction to the Concept of Computer-aided Human Life (CAHL) System

## Overview

Computer-aided human life (CAHL) system is a new concept to be introduced by this article. The idea of CAHL originates
from the similar term: Computer-aided design (CAD). Similar to CAD, CAHL is the use of computer systems to aid in daily
human life including every possible aspect. Although CAHL is a new concept, some related technologies have already
existed for decades. The introduction of CAHL is aimed at setting an objective or direction for current technology
development and providing a new point of view to review those related technologies.

Human life has always been aided since the born of earliest technology. We use fire to cook food for many thousands of
years. However the rapid development of electronic and information technology provides a variety of new possiblities
how technology can aid human life and how close it can get involve in our daily life. (TO BE CONTINUE HERE...)

In fact, the original term for CAHL is Computer-aided life (CAL) system. In order to emphasize the importance of human.
Designers and developers of any CAHL system should always keep in mind that human is in central position of CAHL system,
any function provided by CAHL should serve human, assist human to accomplish human's own objectives or wishes.
